      <p>
        Hello! I’m Kamunge, a passionate fullstack developer with a knack for
        turning ideas into reality through code. With expertise in a diverse
        range of technologies, I thrive in both front-end and back-end
        development, ensuring seamless user experiences and robust
        functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey in tech has equipped me with proficiency in <span className="highlight">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React and Next.js</span>, along with backend        technologies such as <span className="highlight">Express.js, MongoDB, and Laravel.</span> I take pride in creating <span className="highlight">responsive, intuitive designs</span> using tools like <span className="highlight">TailwindCSS and Bootstrap,</span> all while maintaining best practices in version control with <span className="highlight"> Git and GitHub.</span>   
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in the importance of testing and automation to deliver
        high-quality software, employing tools like <span className="highlight">Jest and Cypress</span> to ensure reliability. My experience with <span className="highlight">CI/CD practices and Docker</span> enhances my ability to streamline development processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies and continuously
        improving my skills to stay ahead in this fast-paced industry. Let’s
        collaborate and bring your project ideas to life!
